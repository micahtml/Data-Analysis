# NBA Season Stat Analysis

This project is a data analysis of the current NBA season's top players and their statistics. It includes visualizations of the top scorers, leaders in various stat categories, and top MVP candidates.

## How It Works

The project is written in Python and uses the Pandas and Matplotlib libraries for data manipulation and visualization. The data is acquired from basketball-reference.com using web scraping techniques.

The code is organized into three main steps:

1. Data Acquisition: The NBA season stat leaders data is collected from basketball-reference.com using web scraping techniques.

2. Data Cleaning: The collected data is cleaned and formatted into a Pandas dataframe for further analysis.

3. Exploratory Data Analysis: The cleaned data is analyzed and visualized using Matplotlib to identify the top scorers, leaders in various stat categories, and top MVP candidates.

## How to Use It

To use the project, follow these steps:

1. Clone the project repository.

2. Install the required Python libraries using pip: Pandas and Matplotlib.

3. Run the main script "main.py" to perform the data analysis and generate the visualizations.

4. The output visualizations will be saved in the "output" directory.

5. To customize the analysis, modify the code in the "main.py" script.
