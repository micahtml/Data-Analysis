# NBA MVP Predictor

This is a predictive analysis project that uses Python and web scraping to predict who will win the MVP award for the current NBA season. The project collects data from the [reference-basketball.com](https://www.reference-basketball.com/stats/players) website and uses linear regression to predict the MVP award winner based on points, rebounds, assists, free throws made, games played, and minutes played.

## How It Works

1. The project starts by using the requests library to send an HTTP request to the reference-basketball.com website and uses BeautifulSoup to extract the required data from the webpage.

2. The project then cleans and preprocesses the extracted data as needed, such as converting string columns to numeric and handling missing data.

3. The project uses seaborn and matplotlib to create visualizations of the data to gain insights and identify patterns in the data.

4. The project selects the most relevant features for predicting the MVP award winner, based on the criteria mentioned earlier.

5. The project trains a linear regression model on the selected features using scikit-learn.

6. The project evaluates the performance of the model using accuracy_score and other relevant metrics.

7. The project deploys the trained model to make predictions on new data, such as a CSV file, and outputs the predicted MVP award winner.

## How to Use It

1. Clone the project repository to your local machine.

2. Install the required libraries using pip or conda:

3. Run the `predict_mvp.py` file using Python:

4. The program will output the predicted MVP award winner for the current NBA season based on the selected features.

5. To use the model to make predictions on new data, create a CSV file with the selected features as columns, and run the program again, specifying the path to the new data file:

6. The program will output the predicted MVP award winner for the new data file based on the selected features.

Enjoy!
